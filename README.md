# Logic & Algorithms Practice - Java

This repository contains my personal solutions to various algorithmic challenges and data structures, showcasing my proficiency in Java and analytical problem-solving skills.

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Password Permutation (Backtracking)
A robust implementation of the **Backtracking** algorithm to generate permutations and find a target password among a set of characters.
- **Key Concepts:** Recursion, State Management (visited array), and Memory Efficiency (StringBuilder).
- **Goal:** Systematically explore a decision tree to find specific character combinations without repetitions.

### 2. Playing Cards Sequence (OBI Challenge)
An implementation of the "Cartas" logic problem from the Brazilian Computing Olympiad (OBI).
- **Goal:** Determine if a sequence of numbers is strictly increasing ('C'), strictly decreasing ('D'), or unordered ('N').
- **Approach:** Single-pass array traversal with state counters to ensure O(n) efficiency.
- **Logic:** Compares adjacent elements to validate the global state of the sequence.

## Skills & Technologies
- **Language:** Java (17+)
- **Concepts:** Backtracking, Recursion, Array Manipulation, and Logic Optimization.
- **Focus:** Clean code and efficient algorithm design.
